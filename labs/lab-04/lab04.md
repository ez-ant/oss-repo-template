3. Add a license help our people contribute to your code. If you do not add a license to your code, other people are not allowed to use it. By adding the appropriate license, you tell other people how to use your code appropiately. 

4. You are not allowed to use a project without license. If you use a project that doesn't have a explicit license, the author of the project may come to you and ask for a compensation.

5. Although I am not familiared with the history of Gopher, I agree with this claim. I believe that the mind share is a factor that impact the development of Gopher. The Web has a much larger instutional influences than Gopher. Gopher lose the community's support when they decide to work on their own instead of unleashing the decisions to the community. Those factors contribute to the fall of Gopher.

The apache license is an open source software license released by the Apache Software Foundation (ASF). People  can freely use, modify, distribute and sell a software licensed under the Apache License without worrying about the use of software: personal, internal or commercial. Andriod choose to use this license since andriod is a mobile operating system and software developers may want to create application based on the system for commercial purpose. Most of the developers do not want to share the code. If they use GNU license, they need to release their full code and all rights to modify and distribute the entire code. Compare to GNU license, the apache license do not have this restriction. In order to attract people creating app on andriod, they  choose to use Apache license.

Andriod's kernel uses GPL v2. In this license, developers need to release their code if they modify Andriod's kernel. This helps keeping the Andriod consistent.
